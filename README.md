**Regent** is a small and elegant TypeScript library for building AI agents that can think, reason, and take actions through tools. It provides a clean, intuitive interface for creating agents that can solve complex problems by breaking them down into logical steps.

## Key Features

- **ReAct Pattern Implementation**: Agents follow the Reasoning-Action pattern, making decisions through a clear thought process before taking actions
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Seamlessly works with:
  - OpenAI (GPT models)
  - Anthropic (Claude models)
  - Google (Gemini models)
- **Extensible Tool System**: Create custom tools that agents can use to interact with external services, APIs, or perform specific tasks
- **Built-in Tracing**: Every agent interaction is traced and can be replayed, making debugging and monitoring straightforward
- **Clean Ruby Interface**: Designed to feel natural to Ruby developers while maintaining powerful capabilities
